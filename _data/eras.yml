  body: "During the early 1900s to 1910s, hair salons and products were virtually non-existent in the black community. Annie Turnbo Malone debuted her Wonderful Hair Grower products in 1902 and eventually one of her sales girls, Madame C.J. Walker, started her own iconic haircare brand in 1905. In 1909, Garrett Morgan accidentally developed the first chemical relaxer. The female version of the relaxer soon follows, and sales skyrocket with the promise of straighter, more Caucasian-like hair texture. 
Popular hairstyles for the time were The Gibson Girl, the pompadour and Marcel waves."

  body: "During the infamous Roaring Twenties, Black women had very few trendy styles. In the 1920s, there was a cultural rebellion, where many women found themselves going against societal norms, which included completely changing the way they wore their hair. The hairstyles that were worn in the 1920s were short Flapper-esque haircuts. Flapper hairstyles were short, ear- or jaw-length bobs that hugged close to the head, sometimes styled with waves or pin curls. Other notable styles during this time included finger waves and short bob cuts with bangs."

  body: "In the 1940s, Black hairstyles took a more elegant spin. During this era, people were becoming more interested in style and aesthetics as they were depicted on the silver screen, giving rise to Hollywood-inspired glamour and screen siren beauty. Soft curly hairstyles and updos were becoming more highly requested during this time. Rollers became very popular, perhaps due to the rise in recognition of pin-up fashion during World War II. Hairstyles prevalent during this time included curls, rolls, scarves, snoods and sleek buns."
