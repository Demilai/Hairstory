  body: "During the early 1900s to 1910s, hair salons and products were virtually non-existent in the black community. Annie Turnbo Malone debuted her Wonderful Hair Grower products in 1902 and eventually one of her sales girls, Madame C.J. Walker, started her own iconic haircare brand in 1905. In 1909, Garrett Morgan accidentally developed the first chemical relaxer. The female version of the relaxer soon follows, and sales skyrocket with the promise of straighter, more Caucasian-like hair texture. 
Popular hairstyles for the time were The Gibson Girl, the pompadour and Marcel waves."
